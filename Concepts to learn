-What is a Virtual Machine?

 A virtual machine allows multiple isolated operating environments to run on the same physical hardware. This provides a convenient and
 cost-effective way to run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical computer.
 Host Operating System: The host operating system is the physical operating system installed on the physical computer or server.
 Virtualization Software: Virtualization software, such as VirtualBox is installed on the host operating system. This software creates 
 and manages the virtual machines and provides the necessary resources such as virtual storage, virtual networking, and virtual
 hardware devices to the virtual machines.
 Virtual Machine: A virtual machine is created by the virtualization software. The virtual machine is an isolated environment that
 has its own operating system, applications, and data.
 Virtual Hardware: The virtual hardware provides the virtual machine with the necessary hardware resources such as virtual CPU, virtual
 memory, virtual hard disk, virtual network interface, and virtual input/output devices.
 Guest Operating System: The guest operating system is installed on the virtual machine. This operating system acts as the primary
 operating system for the virtual machine and provides the necessary environment for running applications.

-The basic differences between CentOS and Debian.

 CentOS and Debian are two popular open-source operating systems used for various purposes, including server and desktop applications.
 Both are powerful and efficient, but the methods for installing, updating, and managing software packages are different.
 Debian has a slower release cycle, with a new stable version released every two years. CentOS follows a more predictable release
 cycle, with new versions released every few years.
 Debian provides a high degree of customization, with many options for customizing the operating system and its components.
 CentOS is more streamlined, with fewer options for customization, but it is more focused on stability and reliability.
 Both Debian and CentOS have large and active communities, but Debian has a larger and more diverse community, with many developers contributing
 to the project.
 In conclusion, Debian is a good choice for projects that require stability and customization, while CentOS is ideal for projects that require
 stability, reliability, and longer support cycles.

-The purpose of virtual machines.
 
 Virtual machines provide a flexible and efficient solution for many IT needs, including resource isolation, application testing,
 improved security, disaster recovery, compatibility testing, and cloud computing.

-The difference between aptitude and apt, and what APPArmor is.

 Aptitude and apt are both package management tools used in Debian-based Linux distributions, such as Ubuntu. Apt is a
 simpler and faster tool for managing packages, while aptitude is a more feature-rich tool that provides a terminal-based user interface
 for managing packages. Aptitude also includes more advanced features, such as automatic dependency resolution and the ability to track
 package changes over time.
 AppArmor: AppArmor is a Linux security module that allows the administrator to define security policies for applications, which are
 enforced by the kernel at runtime. It provides a flexible and easy-to-use mechanism for controlling access to files, network resources,
 and other system components. AppArmor helps prevent unauthorized access to resources and reduces the risk of security breaches by
 controlling the behavior of applications running on the system.

-What's a .vdi file?

 A .vdi file is a virtual disk image file format that is used by VirtualBox, an open-source virtualization software. A virtual disk image
 contains the contents of a virtual machine's hard disk, including the operating system, applications, data, and configuration files.
 The .vdi file can be used to store virtual machines on a host computer and can be easily transported to another computer running VirtualBox.
 When loaded into VirtualBox, the .vdi file is treated as a physical disk and the virtual machine running on the host computer can access its
 contents just like it would access a physical hard disk.
